42 ## Building the library and applications
43 
44 ### Prerequisites
45 
46  1. [CMake](https://cmake.org) version 3.5 or higher.
47  2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
48  3. [Perl](https://www.perl.org/).
49  4. For x86 targets, [yasm](http://yasm.tortall.net/), which is preferred, or a
50     recent version of [nasm](http://www.nasm.us/).
51  5. Building the documentation requires [doxygen](http://doxygen.org).
52  6. Building the unit tests requires [Python](https://www.python.org/).
53  7. Emscripten builds require the portable
54    [EMSDK](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/index.html).
55 
56 ### Get the code
57 
58 The AV1 library source code is stored in the Alliance for Open Media Git
59 repository:
60 
61 ~~~
62     $ git clone https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom
63     # By default, the above command stores the source in the aom directory:
64     $ cd aom
65 ~~~
66 
67 ### Basic build
68 
69 CMake replaces the configure step typical of many projects. Running CMake will
70 produce configuration and build files for the currently selected CMake
71 generator. For most systems the default generator is Unix Makefiles. The basic
72 form of a makefile build is the following:
73 
74 ~~~
75     $ cmake path/to/aom
76     $ make
77 ~~~
78 
79 The above will generate a makefile build that produces the AV1 library and
80 applications for the current host system after the make step completes
81 successfully. The compiler chosen varies by host platform, but a general rule
82 applies: On systems where cc and c++ are present in $PATH at the time CMake is
83 run the generated build will use cc and c++ by default.
84 
85 ### Configuration options
86 
87 The AV1 codec library has a great many configuration options. These come in two
88 varieties:
89 
90  1. Build system configuration options. These have the form `ENABLE\_FEATURE`.
91  2. AV1 codec configuration options. These have the form `CONFIG\_FEATURE`.
92 
93 Both types of options are set at the time CMake is run. The following example
94 enables ccache and disables the AV1 encoder:
95 
96 ~~~
97     $ cmake path/to/aom -DENABLE\_CCACHE=1 -DCONFIG\_AV1\_ENCODER=0
98     $ make
99 ~~~
100 
101 The available configuration options are too numerous to list here. Build system
102 configuration options can be found at the top of the CMakeLists.txt file found
103 in the root of the AV1 repository, and AV1 codec configuration options can
104 currently be found in the file `build/cmake/aom\_config\_defaults.cmake`.
105 
106 ### Dylib builds
107 
108 A dylib (shared object) build of the AV1 codec library can be enabled via the
109 CMake built in variable `BUILD\_SHARED\_LIBS`:
110 
111 ~~~
112     $ cmake path/to/aom -DBUILD\_SHARED\_LIBS=1
113     $ make
114 ~~~
115 
116 This is currently only supported on non-Windows targets.
117 
118 ### Debugging
119 
120 Depending on the generator used there are multiple ways of going about
121 debugging AV1 components. For single configuration generators like the Unix
122 Makefiles generator, setting `CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE` to Debug is sufficient:
123 
124 ~~~
125     $ cmake path/to/aom -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug
126 ~~~
127 
128 For Xcode, mainly because configuration controls for Xcode builds are buried two
129 configuration windows deep and must be set for each subproject within the Xcode
130 IDE individually, `CMAKE\_CONFIGURATION\_TYPES` should be set to Debug:
131 
132 ~~~
133     $ cmake path/to/aom -G Xcode -DCMAKE\_CONFIGURATION\_TYPES=Debug
134 ~~~
135 
136 For Visual Studio the in-IDE configuration controls should be used. Simply set
137 the IDE project configuration to Debug to allow for stepping through the code.
138 
139 In addition to the above it can sometimes be useful to debug only C and C++
140 code. To disable all assembly code and intrinsics set `AOM\_TARGET\_CPU` to
141 generic at generation time:
142 
143 ~~~
144     $ cmake path/to/aom -DAOM\_TARGET\_CPU=generic
145 ~~~
146 
147 ### Cross compiling
148 
149 For the purposes of building the AV1 codec and applications and relative to the
150 scope of this guide, all builds for architectures differing from the native host
151 architecture will be considered cross compiles. The AV1 CMake build handles
152 cross compiling via the use of toolchain files included in the AV1 repository.
153 The toolchain files available at the time of this writing are:
154 
155  - arm64-ios.cmake
156  - arm64-linux-gcc.cmake
157  - arm64-mingw-gcc.cmake
158  - armv7-ios.cmake
159  - armv7-linux-gcc.cmake
160  - armv7-mingw-gcc.cmake
161  - armv7s-ios.cmake
162  - mips32-linux-gcc.cmake
163  - mips64-linux-gcc.cmake
164  - x86-ios-simulator.cmake
165  - x86-linux.cmake
166  - x86-macos.cmake
167  - x86-mingw-gcc.cmake
168  - x86\(\backslash\)\_64-ios-simulator.cmake
169  - x86\(\backslash\)\_64-mingw-gcc.cmake
170 
171 The following example demonstrates use of the x86-macos.cmake toolchain file on
172 a x86\(\backslash\)\_64 MacOS host:
173 
174 ~~~
175     $ cmake path/to/aom \(\backslash\)
176       -DCMAKE\_TOOLCHAIN\_FILE=path/to/aom/build/cmake/toolchains/x86-macos.cmake
177     $ make
178 ~~~
179 
180 To build for an unlisted target creation of a new toolchain file is the best
181 solution. The existing toolchain files can be used a starting point for a new
182 toolchain file since each one exposes the basic requirements for toolchain files
183 as used in the AV1 codec build.
184 
185 As a temporary work around an unoptimized AV1 configuration that builds only C
186 and C++ sources can be produced using the following commands:
187 
188 ~~~
189     $ cmake path/to/aom -DAOM\_TARGET\_CPU=generic
190     $ make
191 ~~~
192 
193 In addition to the above it's important to note that the toolchain files
194 suffixed with gcc behave differently than the others. These toolchain files
195 attempt to obey the $CROSS environment variable.
196 
197 ### Sanitizers
198 
199 Sanitizer integration is built-in to the CMake build system. To enable a
200 sanitizer, add `-DSANITIZE=<type>` to the CMake command line. For example, to
201 enable address sanitizer:
202 
203 ~~~
204     $ cmake path/to/aom -DSANITIZE=address
205     $ make
206 ~~~
207 
208 Sanitizers available vary by platform, target, and compiler. Consult your
209 compiler documentation to determine which, if any, are available.
210 
211 ### Microsoft Visual Studio builds
212 
213 Building the AV1 codec library in Microsoft Visual Studio is supported. The
214 following example demonstrates generating projects and a solution for the
215 Microsoft IDE:
216 
217 ~~~
218     # This does not require a bash shell; command.exe is fine.
219     $ cmake path/to/aom -G "Visual Studio 15 2017"
220 ~~~
221 
222 ### Xcode builds
223 
224 Building the AV1 codec library in Xcode is supported. The following example
225 demonstrates generating an Xcode project:
226 
227 ~~~
228     $ cmake path/to/aom -G Xcode
229 ~~~
230 
231 ### Emscripten builds
232 
233 Building the AV1 codec library with Emscripten is supported. Typically this is
234 used to hook into the AOMAnalyzer GUI application. These instructions focus on
235 using the inspector with AOMAnalyzer, but all tools can be built with
236 Emscripten.
237 
238 It is assumed here that you have already downloaded and installed the EMSDK,
239 installed and activated at least one toolchain, and setup your environment
240 appropriately using the emsdk\(\backslash\)\_env script.
241 
242 1. Download [AOMAnalyzer](https://people.xiph.org/~mbebenita/analyzer/).
243 
244 2. Configure the build:
245 
246 ~~~
247     $ cmake path/to/aom \(\backslash\)
248         -DENABLE\_CCACHE=1 \(\backslash\)
249         -DAOM\_TARGET\_CPU=generic \(\backslash\)
250         -DENABLE\_DOCS=0 \(\backslash\)
251         -DENABLE\_TESTS=0 \(\backslash\)
252         -DCONFIG\_ACCOUNTING=1 \(\backslash\)
253         -DCONFIG\_INSPECTION=1 \(\backslash\)
254         -DCONFIG\_MULTITHREAD=0 \(\backslash\)
255         -DCONFIG\_RUNTIME\_CPU\_DETECT=0 \(\backslash\)
256         -DCONFIG\_WEBM\_IO=0 \(\backslash\)
257         -DCMAKE\_TOOLCHAIN\_FILE=path/to/emsdk-portable/.../Emscripten.cmake
258 ~~~
259 
260 3. Build it: run make if that's your generator of choice:
261 
262 ~~~
263     $ make inspect
264 ~~~
265 
266 4. Run the analyzer:
267 
268 ~~~
269     # inspect.js is in the examples sub directory of the directory in which you
270     # executed cmake.
271     $ path/to/AOMAnalyzer path/to/examples/inspect.js path/to/av1/input/file
272 ~~~
273 
274 ### Extra build flags
275 
276 Three variables allow for passing of additional flags to the build system.
277 
278 - AOM\(\backslash\)\_EXTRA\(\backslash\)\_C\(\backslash\)\_FLAGS
279 - AOM\(\backslash\)\_EXTRA\(\backslash\)\_CXX\(\backslash\)\_FLAGS
280 - AOM\(\backslash\)\_EXTRA\(\backslash\)\_EXE\(\backslash\)\_LINKER\(\backslash\)\_FLAGS
281 
282 The build system attempts to ensure the flags passed through the above variables
283 are passed to tools last in order to allow for override of default behavior.
284 These flags can be used, for example, to enable asserts in a release build:
285 
286 ~~~
287     $ cmake path/to/aom \(\backslash\)
288         -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release \(\backslash\)
289         -DAOM\_EXTRA\_C\_FLAGS=-UNDEBUG \(\backslash\)
290         -DAOM\_EXTRA\_CXX\_FLAGS=-UNDEBUG
291 ~~~
292 
293 ## Testing the AV1 codec
294 
295 ### Testing basics
296 
297 There are several methods of testing the AV1 codec. All of these methods require
298 the presence of the AV1 source code and a working build of the AV1 library and
299 applications.
300 
301 #### 1. Unit tests:
302 
303 The unit tests can be run at build time:
304 
305 ~~~
306     # Before running the make command the LIBAOM\_TEST\_DATA\_PATH environment
307     # variable should be set to avoid downloading the test files to the
308     # cmake build configuration directory.
309     $ cmake path/to/aom
310     # Note: The AV1 CMake build creates many test targets. Running make
311     # with multiple jobs will speed up the test run significantly.
312     $ make runtests
313 ~~~
314 
315 #### 2. Example tests:
316 
317 The example tests require a bash shell and can be run in the following manner:
318 
319 ~~~
320     # See the note above about LIBAOM\_TEST\_DATA\_PATH above.
321     $ cmake path/to/aom
322     $ make
323     # It's best to build the testdata target using many make jobs.
324     # Running it like this will verify and download (if necessary)
325     # one at a time, which takes a while.
326     $ make testdata
327     $ path/to/aom/test/examples.sh --bin-path examples
328 ~~~
329 
330 #### 3. Encoder tests:
331 
332 When making a change to the encoder run encoder tests to confirm that your
333 change has a positive or negligible impact on encode quality. When running these
334 tests the build configuration should be changed to enable internal encoder
335 statistics:
336 
337 ~~~
338     $ cmake path/to/aom -DCONFIG\_INTERNAL\_STATS=1
339     $ make
340 ~~~
341 
342 The repository contains scripts intended to make running these tests as simple
343 as possible. The following example demonstrates creating a set of baseline clips
344 for comparison to results produced after making your change to libaom:
345 
346 ~~~
347     # This will encode all Y4M files in the current directory using the
348     # settings specified to create the encoder baseline statistical data:
349     $ cd path/to/test/inputs
350     # This command line assumes that run\_encodes.sh, its helper script
351     # best\_encode.sh, and the aomenc you intend to test are all within a
352     # directory in your PATH.
353     $ run\_encodes.sh 200 500 50 baseline
354 ~~~
355 
356 After making your change and creating the baseline clips, you'll need to run
357 encodes that include your change(s) to confirm that things are working as
358 intended:
359 
360 ~~~
361     # This will encode all Y4M files in the current directory using the
362     # settings specified to create the statistical data for your change:
363     $ cd path/to/test/inputs
364     # This command line assumes that run\_encodes.sh, its helper script
365     # best\_encode.sh, and the aomenc you intend to test are all within a
366     # directory in your PATH.
367     $ run\_encodes.sh 200 500 50 mytweak
368 ~~~
369 
370 After creating both data sets you can use `test/visual\_metrics.py` to generate a
371 report that can be viewed in a web browser:
372 
373 ~~~
374     $ visual\_metrics.py metrics\_template.html "*stt" baseline mytweak \(\backslash\)
375       > mytweak.html
376 ~~~
377 
378 You can view the report by opening mytweak.html in a web browser.
379 
380 
381 ### IDE hosted tests
382 
383 By default the generated projects files created by CMake will not include the
384 runtests and testdata rules when generating for IDEs like Microsoft Visual
385 Studio and Xcode. This is done to avoid intolerably long build cycles in the
386 IDEs-- IDE behavior is to build all targets when selecting the build project
387 options in MSVS and Xcode. To enable the test rules in IDEs the
388 `ENABLE\_IDE\_TEST\_HOSTING` variable must be enabled at CMake generation time:
389 
390 ~~~
391     # This example uses Xcode. To get a list of the generators
392     # available, run cmake with the -G argument missing its
393     # value.
394     $ cmake path/to/aom -DENABLE\_IDE\_TEST\_HOSTING=1 -G Xcode
395 ~~~
396 
397 ### Downloading the test data
398 
399 The fastest and easiest way to obtain the test data is to use CMake to generate
400 a build using the Unix Makefiles generator, and then to build only the testdata
401 rule:
402 
403 ~~~
404     $ cmake path/to/aom -G "Unix Makefiles"
405     # 28 is used because there are 28 test files as of this writing.
406     $ make -j28 testdata
407 ~~~
408 
409 The above make command will only download and verify the test data.
410 
411 ### Adding a new test data file
412 
413 First, add the new test data file to the `aom-test-data` bucket of the
414 `aomedia-testing` project on Google Cloud Platform. You may need to ask someone
415 with the necessary access permissions to do this for you.
416 
417 Once the new test data file has been added to `aom-test-data`, create a CL to
418 add the name of the new test data file to `test/test\_data\_util.cmake` and add
419 the SHA1 checksum of the new test data file to `test/test-data.sha1`. (The SHA1
420 checksum of a file can be calculated by running the `sha1sum` command on the
421 file.)
422 
423 ### Additional test data
424 
425 The test data mentioned above is strictly intended for unit testing.
426 
427 Additional input data for testing the encoder can be obtained from:
428 https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/
429 
430 ### Sharded testing
431 
432 The AV1 codec library unit tests are built upon gtest which supports sharding of
433 test jobs. Sharded test runs can be achieved in a couple of ways.
434 
435 #### 1. Running test\(\backslash\)\_libaom directly:
436 
437 ~~~
438    # Set the environment variable GTEST\_TOTAL\_SHARDS to control the number of
439    # shards.
440    $ export GTEST\_TOTAL\_SHARDS=10
441    # (GTEST shard indexing is 0 based).
442    $ seq 0 $(( $GTEST\_TOTAL\_SHARDS - 1 )) \(\backslash\)
443        | xargs -n 1 -P 0 -I\{\} env GTEST\_SHARD\_INDEX=\{\} ./test\_libaom
444 ~~~
445 
446 To create a test shard for each CPU core available on the current system set
447 `GTEST\_TOTAL\_SHARDS` to the number of CPU cores on your system minus one.
448 
449 #### 2. Running the tests via the CMake build:
450 
451 ~~~
452     # For IDE based builds, ENABLE\_IDE\_TEST\_HOSTING must be enabled. See
453     # the IDE hosted tests section above for more information. If the IDE
454     # supports building targets concurrently tests will be sharded by default.
455 
456     # For make and ninja builds the -j parameter controls the number of shards
457     # at test run time. This example will run the tests using 10 shards via
458     # make.
459     $ make -j10 runtests
460 ~~~
461 
462 The maximum number of test targets that can run concurrently is determined by
463 the number of CPUs on the system where the build is configured as detected by
464 CMake. A system with 24 cores can run 24 test shards using a value of 24 with
465 the `-j` parameter. When CMake is unable to detect the number of cores 10 shards
466 is the default maximum value.
467 
468 ## Coding style
469 
470 We are using the Google C Coding Style defined by the
471 [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
472 
473 The coding style used by this project is enforced with clang-format using the
474 configuration contained in the
475 [.clang-format](https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/aom/+/master/.clang-format)
476 file in the root of the repository.
477 
478 You can download clang-format using your system's package manager, or directly
479 from [llvm.org](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html). You can also view the
480 [documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) on llvm.org.
481 Output from clang-format varies by clang-format version, for best results your
482 version should match the one used on Jenkins. You can find the clang-format
483 version by reading the comment in the `.clang-format` file linked above.
484 
485 Before pushing changes for review you can format your code with:
486 
487 ~~~
488     # Apply clang-format to modified .c, .h and .cc files
489     $ clang-format -i --style=file \(\backslash\)
490       $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR '*.[hc]' '*.cc')
491 ~~~
492 
493 Check the .clang-format file for the version used to generate it if there is any
494 difference between your local formatting and the review system.
495 
496 Some Git installations have clang-format integration. Here are some examples:
497 
498 ~~~
499     # Apply clang-format to all staged changes:
500     $ git clang-format
501 
502     # Clang format all staged and unstaged changes:
503     $ git clang-format -f
504 
505     # Clang format all staged and unstaged changes interactively:
506     $ git clang-format -f -p
507 ~~~
508 
509 ## Submitting patches
510 
511 We manage the submission of patches using the
512 [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) code review tool. This tool
513 implements a workflow on top of the Git version control system to ensure that
514 all changes get peer reviewed and tested prior to their distribution.

521 instructions for creating a cookie to use with our Git repos.
522 
523 ### Contributor agreement
524 
525 You will be required to execute a
526 [contributor agreement](http://aomedia.org/license) to ensure that the AOMedia
527 Project has the right to distribute your changes.
528 
529 ### Testing your code
530 
531 The testing basics are covered in the [testing section](#testing-the-av1-codec)
532 above.
533 
534 In addition to the local tests, many more (e.g. asan, tsan, valgrind) will run
535 through Jenkins instances upon upload to gerrit.
536 
537 ### Commit message hook
538 
539 Gerrit requires that each submission include a unique Change-Id. You can assign
540 one manually using git commit --amend, but it’s easier to automate it with the
541 commit-msg hook provided by Gerrit.
542 
543 Copy commit-msg to the `.git/hooks` directory of your local repo. Here's an
544 example:
545 
546 ~~~
547     $ curl -Lo aom/.git/hooks/commit-msg https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/tools/hooks/commit-msg
548 
549     # Next, ensure that the downloaded commit-msg script is executable:
550     $ chmod u+x aom/.git/hooks/commit-msg
551 ~~~
552 
553 See the Gerrit
554 [documentation](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/user-changeid.html)
555 for more information.
556 
557 ### Upload your change
558 
559 The command line to upload your patch looks like this:
560 
561 ~~~
562     $ git push https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/aom HEAD:refs/for/master
563 ~~~
564 
565 ### Incorporating reviewer comments
566 
567 If you previously uploaded a change to Gerrit and the Approver has asked for
568 changes, follow these steps:
569 
570 1. Edit the files to make the changes the reviewer has requested.
571 2. Recommit your edits using the --amend flag, for example:
572 
573 ~~~
574    $ git commit -a --amend
575 ~~~
576 
577 3. Use the same git push command as above to upload to Gerrit again for another
578    review cycle.
579 
580 In general, you should not rebase your changes when doing updates in response to
581 review. Doing so can make it harder to follow the evolution of your change in
582 the diff view.
583 
584 ### Submitting your change
585 
586 Once your change has been Approved and Verified, you can “submit” it through the
587 Gerrit UI. This will usually automatically rebase your change onto the branch
588 specified.
589 
590 Sometimes this can’t be done automatically. If you run into this problem, you
591 must rebase your changes manually:
592 
593 ~~~
594     $ git fetch
595     $ git rebase origin/branchname
596 ~~~
597 
598 If there are any conflicts, resolve them as you normally would with Git. When
599 you’re done, reupload your change.
600 
601 ### Viewing the status of uploaded changes
602 
603 To check the status of a change that you uploaded, open
604 [Gerrit](https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/), sign in, and click My >
